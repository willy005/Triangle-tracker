How it works.
1.
If the sum of two sides is equal or exceeds the value of the third side, then the program will detect that the values do not form a definite triangle.
Example!
 --input - hypotenuse (7), opposite (2), adjacent (19)
 --output - values show an indefinite triangle. 2- if the values entered are all equal to one another, then the program would show that an Equilateral triangle. --input - first value (8), second value (8), third value (8) --output - Triangle is Equilateral. 3- if two values in the input are equal, third different, the program would show an iscoceles triangle. --input - first value (6), second value (6), third value(5) --output - Triangle is Iscoceles. 4- if the values entered differ but don't exceed each other by much, triangle would be a Scalene triangle. --input - first value (7), second value (5), third value (8) --output- Triangle is Scalene.
