#       How it works.
#
If the sum of two sides is equal or exceeds the value of the third side, then the program will detect that the values do not form a definite triangle.

#Example!
# Input - hypotenuse (7), opposite (2), adjacent (19)
# Output = values show an indefinite triangle.

#
If the values entered are all equal to one another, then the program would show that it is an Equilateral triangle.
#Input - first value (8), second value (8), third value (8)
#output - Triangle is Equilateral.

#
If two values in the input are equal, third different, the program would show an iscoceles triangle.
#Example!
#Input - first value (6), second value (6), third value(5)
#output - Triangle is Iscoceles.
#
If the values entered differ but don't exceed each other by much, triangle would be a Scalene triangle.
#Example!
#Input - first value (7), second value (5), third value (8)
#Output- Triangle is Scalene.
